# Week 4 Thoughts

I feel like this week should have been pretty easy but I had to completely rewrite my code and went with a different story. I was struggling to get it to work properly and now I feel like I got it down to where it works close to how I had intended in the first place. Things just seem to keep getting harder but I will continue to power through and do my best to complete this course to my best ability!
