# Week 6 Thoughts

This week was really fun! It was nice to have a more relaxed assignment and it's cool to see that I can create a game and store user information as well as call it back to a new page! One of the best weeks I've had and I feel pretty good about it. The only struggle I'm having is trying to retain all of this information as I try to hammer through these assignments as I near the deadline. Other than that, fairly smooth sailing and fun times!
