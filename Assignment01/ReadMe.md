# Week 1 Thoughts

This first week was really difficult for me because I had nearly forgotten everything I knew about coding and had to revisit the previous course to freshen up on coding. As you know, I had  a really hard time figuring out how to code a background image but was able to find a way to add it to my HTML. I know that style elements are supposed to be located in the CSS section but I couldn't get it to work for the life of me so I hope theres no issue there. Other than that I really like the work I put out and hope you do too! I also want to thank you for the extension, and apologize for inconveniencing you during your summer because I know you probably have other things to tend to as I do. I will do my best to complete this course on my own and strive to give you quality work each week!
