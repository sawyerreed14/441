# Week 11 Thoughts

I'd like to start off by saying I'm confused as to why there is no week 10 but that's ok I'll take one less week! This week was fairly simple and I honestly really enjoyed this one because of how much fun it was to get some real interactive elements in there! Of course we have worked with other types of interactive elements before user control (even if its as simple as controlling a square) is much more entertaining! This week went incredibly smooth and I have no complaints.
