# Week 8 Thoughts
This week seemed pretty simple until the homework assignment. I was able to successfully create the webpage that was asked for but it's not as stylish and fun as I had hoped for. The real struggle this week was figuring out how to get the shapes to work properly and how to set the intervals for the movement. It wasn't too difficult to animate the text and images and whatnot but I can tell you first hand that it was a pain in the ass and took me a lot longer than I wanted to spend on it. With that being said, I didn't get the most beautiful webpage but the functionality is on par!
