# Week 5 Thoughts

This week was a little bit easier than last week although the struggle was still there. Arrays were definitely a challenge, but learning about debugging was a great way for me to be able to check my code and see exactly where things were going wrong. All of this new information is stressful as it comes but I'm glad I'm able to learn and figure things out! hopefully next week continues to go smooth as this week did.
