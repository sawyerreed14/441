# Week 13 Thoughts

This week was really fun and interesting! I already really enjoyed learning about creating my own canvas and adding user control to objects and things like that but this takes it to a whole new level! Never would I have thought that in this class I would be able to make my own type of game that I could stylize like this. I've said it before and I will say it again, this was my favorite week so far! Really fun and well explained, no real struggles or issues!
