// My 3 favorite artists and their cultural importance.
console.log("I would go with the the Isley brothers as my three favorite artists because there are three of them in the group. They are important for the culture of music becuase they were original and paved the way for many other artists who have modeled their music after them or even sampled it. Some examples of songs that use the Isleys instrumentals are 'It Was A Good Day' by Ice Cube and 'Big Poppa' by Biggie.");
