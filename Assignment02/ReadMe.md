# Week 2 Thoughts

This weeks work was fairly simple and I like how it eases into JavaScript rather than jumping in head first with no prior knowledge. I had a lot of fun messing around on the JavaScript website and I think I will enjoy going more into depth with this! Please let me know if I need to fix anything with my console log or file structure.
