# Week 9 Thoughts

I may have said this before but this is by far the hardest week I've had. For some odd reason I can't figure out for the life of me how to get my json to display properly. I've inspected the page to do debug the errors but I cant figure out what the error is trying to get me to fix. Through countless research throughout the internet I can't get it to work properly and feel defeated. I feel like my code is done properly and neatly but I just cant find this subtle error that is screwing up my page. I hope at least all of my time and effort is worth something.

P.S.
The reason I made my own data was to see if I could make it more simplified to try and get the code to work.
